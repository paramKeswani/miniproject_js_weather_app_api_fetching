Ap is used to communicate between the two systems 
for example one can understand it as consider you have went to a restuarantand in that there is a waiter you call the waiter and tell the waiter that you want an icecream 
and so witer goes to the chef and asks the chef to make an iceream for you and when the icecream is made and ready he comes gives the ice cream to you 

so here waiter is acting as an api which acts as a source of communication between system1 (you ) and chef(system 2)(server)


in this we are making a weatherapp
1.which shows the weather of current location or city 
2. you give the input of a city and its wetaher will be displayed 

here you are a client 
so from where this weather will be known you down know whats the weather 
so all this data is fetched from some server using api 
so whenever you type the name of the city a request is ent to the server i.e api to fetch some data and if you are the valid user like

you have api key and all then your request will be accepted and then a response will be sent 

api key is the credential used by the server like if u are a registetred  user or not 
here will use open weather api 
apikey is secret key 

api key :
a0dd0a1fc6166396bfd09c7f89f51525

640537739ea22008a55d732be0f4f500

rapid api gives free api then theree some github pages where we get the free api 

i api calls we dont knoww when the response will come so whnever working with api we are using 
async and await 

in all acertain types of things all things are done using async and await 
like i dont kmow when will i get the respoipnse

so all asynchronous things are done 

api calls work on promises 

here he is using the approch of making thngs visible and invisble suing the css property of active and not active
so yeah its something kind of a new approach 

lets keep that approach after making the things 


loading thing in weather app is impaortant as its taking into consideration the importance offetching the api and 
the time required and ll that stuff how much time the loading should take place 

how the api takes current longitude and latitude on its own



navigator. geolocation. getCurrentPosition() 

const x = document.getElementById("demo");

function getLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
  } else {
    x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
  }
}

function showPosition(position) {
  x.innerHTML = "Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude +
  "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
}

api calls are like network requests
call back function 
function trhat takes input as another function as irts argument


In JavaScript, getElementsByClassName returns a collection of elements with the specified class name. This function returns an array-like object called a NodeList, which is similar to an array but lacks some of the array methods.

When you access elements by class name using getElementsByClassName, it returns a collection, even if there's only one element with that class name. In your case, you're accessing elements with the class name 'wrapper'.

so 0 is used 

var wrapper = document.getElementsByClassName('wrapper')[0];

classList in js
switching tabs in js 
active class and all 
sessionstorage in js 
 sessionstorage.getItem("")

 operation chaining example :
 user?.address?.zip

 JSON.stringyfy(userCoordinates)
 e.preventDefault()

 searchInput.Value

 async thing
